# Le bot - postiflix

For my fake netflix that i created ( refer to swagman.fr for more infos)

I want my users, to use something else that the graphic interface availbles because for non POWER users, it might no be straight forward, having to switch app to, download, watch, see the download progresion..

That's why, i plan on building a *WhatsApp* bot, connected to mistral AI, free API tier to make choices between the tools I will make availble.

To starts downloads, from the chatbot, see the current progress, see what is avaible as a film, and launch the download from it etc etc..
